    "Never push secrets: Do not hardcode your Database Password or Django Secret Key in your code. Use environment variables on Render.\n",

    "Pro-Tip: If you see a `\"Merge Conflict\"` error, it means the code on GitHub is different from your laptop. Usually, running `git pull origin main` followed by `git push` will resolve it."
